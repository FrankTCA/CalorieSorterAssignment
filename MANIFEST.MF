# APCSA Calorie Sorter

The AP Computer Science A Lab Data, Data, Data asks for a calorie sorting program to be created.

I will attach a working jar file in Releases to try out yourself.

Unlike the other GitHubs I have created, this one does not require any environment other than a working java runtime.
